## Code usage

There are several terms/keywords defined in this project.
To clarify, we use the terms as follows:

* ```jasa_figure1.R```: reproducing Figure 1 showing a solution in the Lorenz attractor plotted in 3D. 

* ```jasa_figure2.R```: reproducing Figure 2 showing trends in per-capita cigarette sales. 

* ```jasa_figure3.R```: reproducing Figure 3 showing trends in per-capita cigarette sales in an adversarial setting.

* ```jasa_figure4.R```: reproducing Figure 4 showing trends in per-capita cigarette sales in adversarial setting after pre-screening. 

* ```jasa_figure5.R```: reproducing Figure 5 showing CCM scores based on correlation between California and control states with varying library size L. 

* ```jasa_figure6.R```: reproducing Figure 6 showing Per-capita cigarette sales trends for California, Connecticut, and Smooth Connecticut. 

* ```jasa_figure7.R```: running to generate results for Figure 7.
* ```jasa_figure8.R```: running to generate results for Figure 8.
* ```jasa_figure9.R```: running to generate results for Figure 9.
* ```jasa_figure10.R```: running to generate results for Figure 10.

* ```jasa_figure11.R```: reproducing Figure 11 showing CCM results on selected pairs from ```CauseEffectPairs```.

* ```jasa_figure12.R```: reproducing Figure 12 showing CCM results on pair 68 from ```CauseEffectPairs```.

* ```jasa_figure13.R```: reproducing Figure 13 showing simulation results by comparing CCM scores in different parameter settings.

* ```box_tobacco.R```: reproducing Figure 7, 8, 9 by using results generated from jasa_figure7.R, jasa_figure8.R, jasa_figure9.R.

* ```box_brexit.R```: reproducing Figure 10 by using results generated from jasa_figure10.R.
